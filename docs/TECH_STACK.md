## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure & Service Details

### **Fly.io**
- **Role:** Hosts backend API and (optionally) static frontend.
- **Why:** Global edge locations, Docker support, easy scaling, and zero-downtime deploys.
- **How Used:** Deploys via GitHub Actions or CLI. Handles SSL, custom domains, and health checks.

### **Upstash**
- **Role:** Redis for BullMQ job queue and caching.
- **Why:** Serverless, pay-per-request, no maintenance, global low-latency.
- **How Used:** Stores job state, progress, and async task data for feed processing.

### **Supabase**
- **Role:** Auth, Postgres DB, and file storage.
- **Why:** Modern, open-source, RLS, JWT, and S3-compatible storage. Great DX.
- **How Used:**
  - **Auth:** Email/password, JWT, and RLS for secure multi-tenant access.
  - **DB:** Stores users, feeds, jobs, analytics, and LLM cache.
  - **Storage:** Stores transformed files, templates, and uploads.

### **Lovable**
- **Role:** No-code/low-code frontend builder and hosting.
- **Why:** Rapid UI iteration, A/B testing, and instant deploys for non-technical users.
- **How Used:** Connects to backend API for all data and actions. Can be replaced with custom React app if needed.

### **Cloudflare**
- **Role:** CDN, DNS, and security.
- **Why:** Fast, global delivery of static assets, DDoS protection, and DNS management.
- **How Used:** Serves static files, protects API endpoints, and manages custom domains.

### **OpenAI**
- **Role:** AI-powered data enrichment and transformation.
- **Why:** Best-in-class LLMs for product data mapping, enrichment, and compliance.
- **How Used:** API calls for field mapping, description generation, and category classification.

### **Stripe**
- **Role:** Payments and billing.
- **Why:** Secure, global, and easy to integrate for subscriptions and one-time payments.
- **How Used:** Handles plan upgrades, webhooks, and payment flows.

### **BullMQ**
- **Role:** Background job queue.
- **Why:** Robust, scalable, and integrates with Redis/Upstash for async processing.
- **How Used:** Manages feed transformation jobs, analytics updates, and file processing.

### **Node.js/Express**
- **Role:** Backend API and worker processes.
- **Why:** Fast, flexible, and widely supported for REST APIs and background jobs.
- **How Used:** Serves all API endpoints, handles uploads, and runs background workers.

### **React/Vite (Optional)**
- **Role:** Custom frontend (if not using Lovable).
- **Why:** For advanced UI/UX, white-label, or partner deployments.
- **How Used:** Consumes the same backend API as Lovable.

## üîí Security & Compliance
- **Supabase RLS:** Row-level security for all user data.
- **JWT Auth:** Stateless, secure authentication for all API calls.
- **Cloudflare:** DDoS protection, SSL, and WAF.
- **Stripe:** PCI-compliant payments.
- **Upstash:** Secure, isolated Redis instances.

---

## ‚ö° Scalability & Reliability
- **Serverless/managed services:** No single point of failure, auto-scaling.
- **Global edge/CDN:** Fast for users everywhere.
- **Async job queue:** Handles spikes, large files, and slow AI calls.
- **API-first:** Easy to add new UIs, partners, or integrations.

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Extensibility
- **Add new marketplaces:** Plug in new templates, categories, and API integrations.
- **Direct API push:** Integrate with Walmart, Amazon, Meta, etc. for one-click listing.
- **Partner/agency portals:** Multi-tenant, white-label, and API access.
- **Advanced analytics:** Real-time dashboards, feedback loops, and AI-driven insights.
