# Monetization & Pricing Model

## Credit Wallet System
- Users have a wallet with a credit balance.
- Credits are loaded via Stripe payments ($10 or $20 top-ups).
- Each upload deducts credits based on the selected processing mode and number of rows (excluding template rows).

## Processing Modes
- **Free:** $0/row, basic LLM/model, best-effort fill, lower quality.
- **Ultra:** $0.15/row, higher quality, more robust enrichment.
- **God Mode:** $0.35/row, max quality, all columns filled, even if low-confidence.

## Stripe Integration
- Stripe is used for secure payments to load wallet credits.
- Users can top up their wallet with $10 or $20 at a time.
- Transaction history and credit balance are visible in the app.

## Flow
1. User uploads a file and selects a processing mode.
2. The system calculates the cost (rows √ó per-row price).
3. Credits are deducted from the wallet.
4. If insufficient credits, user is prompted to top up via Stripe.
5. All logic is enforced in the backend and ready for FE integration.

**Jadoo: Bring trash data. Sell everywhere.**
