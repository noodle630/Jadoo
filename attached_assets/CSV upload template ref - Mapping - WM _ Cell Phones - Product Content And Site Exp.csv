And iPhone XS Max makes it massive, with a screen that measures 6.5 inches. The OLED panels in iPhone XS allow for an HDR display with the industry's best color accuracy, true blacks, and remarkable brightness and contrast. They're the sharpest displays, with the highest pixel density, on any Apple device. Advanced color management automatically displays your content in wide color. So everything you look at looks beautiful. With support for Dolby Vision and HDR10 titles from iTunes, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Video, movie night comes to iPhone. Wider stereo playback makes it all sound great. And your HDR photos - even those you captured before - will have a 60 percent greater dynamic range. An innovative dual-camera system integrates the ISP, the Neural Engine, and advanced algorithms to unlock creative possibilities and help you capture incredible photos. Leveraging multiple technologies - like faster sensors, an enhanced ISP, and advanced algorithms - Smart HDR brings more highlight and shadow detail to your photos. Take a great portrait and make it even more amazing with Depth Control, which lets you adjust the depth of field to blur the background as much or as little as you want. The TrueDepth camera generates a precise depth map to keep you in focus against a blurred background. Depth Control lets you adjust the depth of field after you shoot. The camera sensor features deeper, larger pixels. Deeper to improve image fidelity. And larger to allow more light to hit the sensor. The result? Even better low? Light photos. Faster sensors, Smart HDR, and zero shutter lag combine to let you freeze a moment in time with more highlight and shadow detail.","Alphanumeric, 10000 characters - Key features will appear as bulleted text on the item page and in search results.
