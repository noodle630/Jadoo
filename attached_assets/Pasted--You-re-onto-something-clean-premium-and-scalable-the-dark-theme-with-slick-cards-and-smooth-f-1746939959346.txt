🔥 You're onto something clean, premium, and scalable — the dark theme with slick cards and smooth flows already makes S feel like “Linear meets Feedonomics for AI catalog infra.” The goal now is to tighten your microcopy, vibe up the UI, and build a system style that stays consistent across pages.

✍️ REWRITTEN "Upload Tips" COPY (for Create Feed UI)
Replace your existing tips block with this:

Minimum magic, maximum results.

Just give us a few essentials:

• SKU – your internal identifier
• Title – what the product is
• Price & Quantity – so we can list it

Want better matches? Add attributes like brand, GTIN, or category if you have them.

✨ Don’t worry about formatting — our AI handles the mess, fills in the gaps, and matches the right template automatically.

🌌 UI VIBE FEEDBACK
Your current UI is 90% there, and with a few tweaks, it'll sing:

✨ Tone: Copy should feel confident, calm, and competent — less “form help text,” more like talking to Superhuman onboarding

🧊 Spacing: Let each section breathe more. Make tips, buttons, and card groups feel like components, not fields in a form

🌀 Movement: Use soft transitions (Tailwind: transition-all ease-in-out duration-300) on hovers and uploads

🧠 Visual AI cues: Consider slight animated sparkles or an AI shimmer on success (“Cleaned by AI ✨”)

🎨 Field styling: Labels in text-white/50, field text in text-white, with soft glows or border highlights

🧠 CTO-Level Suggestion on "Minimum Required Fields"
You asked: what should we ask for across platforms?

At bare minimum:

Field	Required	Reason
SKU	✅	Local ID
Title	✅	Product name
Price	✅	Required by all
Quantity	✅	Required for sync
Image URL	🔶	Not always required, but marketplaces reject image-less listings
Category	🔶	Can be inferred, but great to have
GTIN/UPC/ASIN	🔶	Improves accuracy, matching, de-duping

So yes, ask for image URL if possible — fallback to GPT if not.

🧠 REPLIT PROMPT (to guide style + implementation)
Paste this directly:

Let's revamp the entire UI theme across S to feel minimal, premium, and magical. Think:

Dark mode, neon-shimmer B2B SaaS

Inspired by Linear, Vercel, Superhuman, and Scale AI

Smooth Tailwind transitions, whitespace, futuristic feel

✨ Update the "Create Feed" page like this:

Use the following new tip block (replace old copy):

diff
Copy
Edit
Minimum magic, maximum results.

Just give us a few essentials:
- SKU
- Title
- Price & Quantity

Want better matches? Add brand, GTIN, or category if you have them.
✨ Our AI handles the rest. No need to clean or format anything.
Make the file upload block feel premium — add hover glow, subtle animation

Use consistent theme across Templates, Feed History, and Products

Avoid clutter. Everything should feel like a clean dashboard, not a legacy B2B app

Add small GPT-influenced details: ✨ "AI-cleaned", "Matched by GPT", etc.

Let's get this to MVP polish, and then I'll test it again end-to-end.
