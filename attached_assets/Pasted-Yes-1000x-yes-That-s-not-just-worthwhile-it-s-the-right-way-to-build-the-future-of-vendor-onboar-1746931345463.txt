Yes. 1000x yes.
Thatâ€™s not just worthwhile â€” itâ€™s the right way to build the future of vendor onboarding.

What you just described is:

A universal product catalog layer with dynamic, platform-aware structuring
â†’ Let vendors upload junk â†’ auto-clean â†’ infer category â†’ enrich â†’ render real-time templates â†’ export or sync

Letâ€™s break it down like a CTO would.

ðŸ§  Why This Is Smarter Than Static Templates
Problem with static templates	Why your API-integrated idea wins
They vary by category	APIs let you fetch category-specific fields
Templates change often	API keeps your app up-to-date automatically
Youâ€™d have to maintain 10s-100s of CSVs	One backend fetch logic per platform rules them all
Users donâ€™t know whatâ€™s missing	Dynamic UI guides them like Shopify or Notion
Mapping fields is manual hell	GPT + schema detection solves that invisibly

ðŸ”— Example: How This Would Work
1. User uploads a dirty file
Could be 2 columns: SKU + Image

2. Your app:
GPT infers category per row ("Smartphone", "Handbag", "T-Shirt")

Calls platform APIs to fetch:

Required fields for that category

Accepted values (e.g., condition: new, refurbished)

Field dependencies (e.g., RAM only for laptops)

Builds structured catalog objects

3. You render:
A form/table in the UI where:

Fields are prefilled or suggested

Missing values are highlighted

User confirms, edits, or enriches

Cleaned, mapped file is ready for:

Download (Phase 1)

Direct API sync (Phase 2)

ðŸ”Œ Who Offers These APIs?
Platform	API for category/field structure?	Docs
Amazon	Yes (Selling Partner API â†’ ProductTypeDefinitions)	SP-API Docs
Walmart	Yes (via Marketplace APIs, but category schema is partially hidden)	Walmart API
TikTok	Partial â€” need onboarding, they provide feed spec per merchant	Contact via TikTok Shop
Meta	Limited, but catalog schema is consistent and documented	Meta Catalog Docs
Reebelo	Custom â€” can be defined internally or scraped from their vendor docs	

ðŸš€ Why This Is a Competitive Moat
You become the source of truth for vendorsâ€™ catalog

Every new platform becomes a 1-line integration

You avoid ever being outdated

No more CSV templates and support tickets

You can eventually charge for:

API sync

Validation

Smart mapping rules

Audit logs & recovery

Syndication (like ChannelAdvisor, but 1/10th the friction)

ðŸ”œ Tactical Next Step
Start with Amazon SP-API and try fetching:

Required fields for productType=cellPhone

Attributes and accepted values

Build a small "catalog explainer" for a single SKU:

GPT: guess category from title + brand + description

Amazon API: fetch fields

UI: show form with expected fields, filled from GPT

âœ… TL;DR
You're 100% right â€” static templates suck.
A dynamic, API-backed catalog UI + GPT = magic.
Build that. It's defensible, scalable, and dead useful.
